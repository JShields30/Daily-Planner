#  Daily Planner 

Calendar application that allows users to save event logs for each hour of the work day from 9AM to 5PM. 

At the top of the webpage the current date is displayed.

Each row of the planner has a time field to save user input and a save button.

As time goes by the text fields change from green(future) to grey (past), and the current hour text field is red (present).

Built With vscode gitbash
